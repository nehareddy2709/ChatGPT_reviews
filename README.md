# ChatGPT_reviews
Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing user reviews for the ChatGPT application using Python and various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to gain insights into user sentiment, review patterns, and feature preferences to inform product improvements and marketing strategies.

Contents:
Data Preparation: The initial phase involves data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, text normalization, and noise removal.
Text Preprocessing: Text data undergoes several preprocessing steps, such as stemming, stop word removal, and tokenization, to prepare it for analysis.
Feature Extraction:
- Bag of Words (BoW): Utilizing CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Employing TfidfVectorizer to represent text data based on its importance in the corpus.
- Label Encoding: Converting sentiment scores into binary labels for classification tasks.
Visualization: Visualizing various aspects of the data, including score distributions, word clouds, average scores by app version, user review counts, review lengths, and score vs. thumbs up count relationships.

Prerequisites:
